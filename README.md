# Web Development Exam Project

This project is my submission for the 'Intro to Web Development' course on the 6th semester of Medialogy at Aalborg University.
This is a 'fake' web shop, which allows much of the regular user flow through a normal webshop. These flows includes signing up, adding products to the product cart, removing unwanted from the cart, and purchasing the products (with fake delivery address & creditcard details). This will also allow the users to change their password, and view their previous orders.
The webshop also has Admin-specific actions, which include creating new products for the page, updating quantities for each product, viewing through all users and orders.
